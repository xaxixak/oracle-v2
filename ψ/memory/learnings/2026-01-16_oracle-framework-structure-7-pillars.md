# # Oracle Framework - ψ/ Structure (7 Pillars)

# Oracle Framework - ψ/ Structure (7 Pillars)

## Directory Architecture
```
ψ/
├── active/      # Ephemeral research (gitignored)
├── inbox/       # Communication, task focus
├── writing/     # Content drafts, long-form
├── lab/         # Experiments, prototypes
├── incubate/    # Active dev repos (gitignored)
├── learn/       # Reference repos (gitignored)
└── memory/      # Persistent knowledge
    ├── resonance/      # Soul identity
    ├── learnings/      # Patterns
    ├── retrospectives/ # Sessions
    └── logs/           # Moments
```

## Knowledge Flow
research → snapshots → retrospectives → patterns → soul identity

## Model Allocation Strategy
- **Haiku**: Bulk extraction, cost-efficient exploration
- **Sonnet**: Analysis, critique, code review
- **Opus**: Quality synthesis, important decisions

## Key Workflows
1. **rrr**: Session retrospective with AI diary
2. **Distillation**: Session → retro → pattern → learning → resonance
3. **Async Work**: Human identifies → agents work → human synthesizes

## Integration Status
oracle-v2 implements memory/ pillar fully.
We have: learnings, retrospectives, traces, decisions.
Missing: active, inbox, writing, lab as formal pillars.
