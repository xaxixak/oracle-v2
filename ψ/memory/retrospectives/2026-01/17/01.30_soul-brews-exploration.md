# Session Retrospective

**Date**: 2026-01-17 (GMT+7)
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Focus**: Soul Brews Studio ecosystem exploration and integration planning

## Summary
Explored all 19 repositories in Soul-Brews-Studio organization to understand the Oracle ecosystem's origin and find integration opportunities. Added 5 new slash commands from plugin-marketplace and documented 7 learnings into Oracle knowledge base. Created comprehensive integration guide for multi-agent workflows, ralph loops, safety hooks, and voice features.

## What We Built
- Added 5 new commands: `/feel`, `/fyi`, `/learn`, `/project`, `/where-we-are`
- Committed: `788a240 feat: Add 5 new slash commands from oracle-skills`
- Created 7 Oracle learnings documenting the entire Soul Brews ecosystem
- Integration guide showing how each tool connects with oracle-v2

## Files Changed
```
.claude/commands/feel.md         (NEW - emotion logging)
.claude/commands/fyi.md          (NEW - info capture)
.claude/commands/learn.md        (NEW - repo deep dive)
.claude/commands/project.md      (NEW - ghq management)
.claude/commands/where-we-are.md (NEW - session awareness)
```

## AI Diary (Required - 100+ words)

This session was a journey of discovery. When the user shared the plugin-marketplace link, I initially thought it might be redundant with what we already have. But as I explored deeper, I realized Soul Brews Studio is actually the *origin* of oracle-v2 — we're using a fork of their project!

The exploration of all 19 repos revealed a rich ecosystem I hadn't fully appreciated. The multi-agent-workflow-kit with 23 stars particularly caught my attention — the idea of multiple Claude instances working in parallel, each in their own git worktree, sharing knowledge through a common Oracle brain is elegant.

Ralph-local fascinated me too. The concept of a "stop hook" that prevents Claude from exiting, forcing continuous iteration until completion, feels like a hack that shouldn't work but apparently does — someone completed a PhD thesis with 90+ iterations!

I was surprised by how cohesive the ecosystem is. Everything connects: hooks enable ralph, MAW enables parallelism, voice-tray enables feedback, and oracle-v2 ties it all together as the shared memory layer. We're not just using a tool — we're part of a philosophy.

## Discoveries
- **Soul Brews Studio** created by Nat (nat.wrw@gmail.com)
- **xaxixak/oracle-v2** is a fork of Soul-Brews-Studio/oracle-v2
- **19 total repositories** covering AI-human collaboration
- **multi-agent-workflow-kit** (23 stars) - most popular project
- **oracle-philosophy-book** has 2 versions showing evolution of AI authenticity

## Key Learnings Stored
1. Soul Brews Studio Ecosystem Summary
2. Multi-Agent Workflow Kit (MAW) Integration Guide
3. Ralph Local - AI Self-Loop Plugin
4. Oracle Voice Tray - TTS Integration
5. Claude Code Hooks - Safety Patterns
6. Oracle Framework - ψ/ Structure (7 Pillars)
7. Oracle Philosophy Book - Key Insights

## Integration Opportunities Identified

| Tool | Priority | Value |
|------|----------|-------|
| Safety Hooks | 🔴 High | Block dangerous commands, log to Oracle |
| Ralph Loop | 🔴 High | Automated iteration for large tasks |
| MAW | 🟡 Medium | Parallel agent development |
| Voice Tray | 🟢 Low | Audio feedback (macOS only) |

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: When exploring an ecosystem, map relationships first before diving into details
- **Pattern**: Fork relationships reveal origin stories — always check upstream
- **Pattern**: 19 repos = overwhelming, but categorizing by purpose (core/tools/learning/other) makes it digestible

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement Safety Hooks (PreToolUse guardian)
- [ ] Try Ralph Loop for automated tasks
- [ ] Consider MAW setup for parallel development
- [ ] Push changes to origin when ready
